This place is a beautiful with well nature. 
In future I will dream live in Montreal, Canada. This is a great city. It’s my a goal.

Well, let me tell about myself.

My education.
I graduated technology university in twenty twelve. Last five years I worked as C&I Engineer. If you know so things like a circuit diagram, PLC, sensors, executive mechanisms and so on, I think you understand me. My job is very interesting, but my move on a new place is a cause lost a work. In past time I used try studied programming, and combine with my work was very hardly for me.

Now I study in RS-School. It takes all my time. I'm very happy. Thanks a lot all stuff, mentors, trainers, and creators school.

From my childhood, I had a dream will do interesting computer games myself. After at last, from half a year I doing a game with is name MineSweeper. Something moments is difficult for me, but I overcoming it. I hope my dream will be a real.
